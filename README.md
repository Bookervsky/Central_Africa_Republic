# Central African Republic Spatiotemporal Data Analysis

This repository aggregates spatiotemporal data for the Central African Republic at the prefecture (province) level.
Those data will be used for conducting spatiotemporal analysis in the future.  <br>

## Aggregated Data

The aggregated data files are available in both csv and geojson formats, located
in [data/Aggregated_prefecture](data/Aggregated_prefecture). <br>
The GeoJSON files use the EPSG:4326 (WGS 1984) coordinate reference system. Area and length values in the CSV and
GeoJSON files are expressed in $m^2$ and $m$, respectively, and were calculated using ESRI:102022 (WGS 1984 Albers for
Africa).
